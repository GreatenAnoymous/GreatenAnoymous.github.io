I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Rutgers University, advised by the esteemed Professor Jingjin Yu. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned my undergraduate degree in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

My research focuses on multi-robot planning, robotic grasping, and robotic visionâ€”areas central to advancing autonomous systems and intelligent robotics. I have also played a key role as an organizer for the [League of Robot Runners](https://www.leagueofrobotrunners.org/), a robotics competition sponsored by Amazon Robotics.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have professional experience as a robotics engineer at Intuitive Autonomy, where I contributed to the development of elder care robots.
