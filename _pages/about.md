I am currently a dedicated Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Rutgers University, under the guidance of the esteemed Prof. Jingjin Yu. My educational background began at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), where I pursued my undergraduate degree in Physics.

My research focuses on multi-robot planning, robotic grasping, and robotic vision. I have also contributed as one of the organizers of the [League of Robot Runners](https://www.leagueofrobotrunners.org/) , sponsored by Amazon Robotics.



I am actively pursuing opportunities in roles such as Applied Scientist, Software Engineer, or Research Scientist.
