I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rutgers University, where I was advised by the esteemed Professor Jingjin Yu. I completed my undergraduate studies in Physics at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

My research focuses on multi-robot planning, robotic grasping, and robotic visionâ€”key areas in the development of intelligent and autonomous robotic systems. I have also served as one of the organizers of the [League of Robot Runners](https://www.leagueofrobotrunners.org/), a robotics competition sponsored by Amazon Robotics.

Before or during my doctoral studies, I worked as a robotics engineer at Intuitive Autonomy, contributing to the design and algorithm development and testing of edler care robots.
