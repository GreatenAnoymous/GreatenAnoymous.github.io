I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, under the guidance of Professor Jingjin Yu. I hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

My research centers on multi-robot planning, robotic grasping, and robotic vision, advancing the development of intelligent, autonomous robotic systems. I also co-organized the  [League of Robot Runners](https://www.leagueofrobotrunners.org/), a robotics competition sponsored by Amazon Robotics.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I worked as a robotics engineer at Intuitive Autonomy, where I contributed to the design, algorithm development, and testing of elder care robots.
